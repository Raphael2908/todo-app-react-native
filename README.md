# TODO App in react native
The goal of this app is to store a list of todos and be able to create, update and delete them. This project served as an introduction to react native which I was enjoyed programming. 

# Lessons learned
- State management is not as easy as it seems
  - Children should have their state managed by their parent via props to prevent re-rendering components unnecessarily
    - This also prevents weird logic and makes everything simpler to manage
- React native feels snappier than flutter back in 2023
- Use uuid for objects in lists to manage them easily -> Deleting and adding items

# Conclusion 
I loved the way react native works with expo and will start on an app that connects to a database soon
